## IMAGE CAROUSEL SLIDER USING GLIDE JS ##
### Build with <a href="https://glidejs.com/" target="_blank">Glide Js</a> ###

### <a href="#">Live Demo</a>

This is a custom project that implements javascript library Glide Js to make customized carousels. This is one of my projects in Web Design Series that i've included link to in this readme file.

##CSS and JS Libraries##
There's not much to these documentation and much information can be found as comments in the index.html, style.css and main.js files. 
In the HTML File, there are links to Glide JS javascript and css file, required to run this in browser.
```HTML
<!-- Heading-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/glide.core.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/glide.theme.min.css" />
<body>
<!--before ending body tag-->
<script src="dist/glide.min.js"></script>
</body>
```
That's all much it. :-)
